## 🚀 Features

- Create a chat room with a custom room code
- Choose how many members are allowed (e.g., 2, 4, custom)
- Share room code with others to join
- Real-time chat using Socket.IO
- Prevent additional users from joining if room is full

## 💬 How to Use the App

### 👤 **User 1 (Room Creator)**

1. Enter your name.
2. Enter how many members should be allowed in the room (example: 2).
3. Click **Create Room**.
4. A random room code (ex: `AB12CD`) will be generated.
5. Share this code with your friend(s).

### 👥 **User 2 (and others)**

1. Enter your name.
2. Enter the **same room code**.
3. Click **Join Room**.
4. Now both of you are in the same chat room.

⛔ **If the room is full**, new users will get a “Room is full” warning and cannot enter.

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

* When a user creates a room:

  * Server stores the room with `maxMembers`
  * Room is created only once (first user)
* When someone joins:

  * Server checks if the room exists
  * Checks if capacity is full
  * If not full → user joins successfully
  * Server broadcasts messages using:

    ```js
    io.to(roomCode).emit("chat-message", payload);
    ```

## 🔧 Development Tips

### Optional: Use nodemon for auto-reload

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

Add to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js",
  "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}
```

Start with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)

* Show list of active users in the room
* Add typing indicators
* Store chat history
* Add UI themes
* Convert frontend to React or Vue
